# About the Project

The dataset used is a record of the relative performance measure and characteristics of 209 CPUs, with their manufacturer, model, cycle time, minimum main memory, maximum main memory, cache size, minimum number of channels, performance and estimated performance.

# How this works
When you select the specifications you want, the data about those CPUs that meat the specifications is shown in the RESULTS tab. After that, on another tab, PERFORMANCE, the comparitive plot of expected and published performance is shown.

# About the Variables

Name: Manufacturer and Model

Cycle Time:            In Nanoseconds

Max Memory:            Maximum Main Memory in KiloBytes

Cache Size:            In KiloBytes

Min Channels:          Minimum Number of Channels

Max Channels:          Maximum Number of Channels

Performance:           Published Performance on a Benchmark Mix Relative to an IBM 370/158-3

Estimated Performance: Estimated Performance (by Ein-Dor & Feldmesser).
