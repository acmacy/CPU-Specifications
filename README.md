# About the Project

The dataset used is a record of the relative performance measure and characteristics of 209 CPUs, with their manufacturer, model, cycle time, minimum main memory, maximum main memory, cache size, minimum number of channels, performance and estimated performance.

# How this works
When you select the specifications you want, the data about those CPUs that meat the specifications is shown in the RESULTS tab. After that, on another tab, PERFORMANCE, the comparitive plot of expected and published performance is shown.
